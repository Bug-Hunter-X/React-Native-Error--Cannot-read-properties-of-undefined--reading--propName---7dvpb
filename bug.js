This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has mounted.  This often happens within the `constructor` or before the component's `render` method has executed.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProp')
    this.state = { count: this.props.initialCount }; // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'initialCount')
  }
  render() {
    return <Text>{this.state.count}</Text>;
  }
}
```
